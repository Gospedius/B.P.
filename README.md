# Better-Pantheons
A mod that alters the starting pantheons to have greater or more logical effect.
Primarily, Faith effects have been added to everything that didn't have any and Faith Healers is now a Follower belief rather than a Pantheon.
This mod exists solely because I was frustrated with chosing fluffy options and then never getting to actually found a religion because the AI always beats me to it, because they're in the middle of a desert and have Desert Folklore or whatever.
