04-10-2022 (Initial Prototype)
Very, very basic version; functional but crude 

06-10-2022 (Version 0.1)
Complete rebuild of the entire Beliefs.json from the ground up, additional buildings added; general rework of religion in general.

07-10-2022 (Version 0.3 initial release)
Let's. Heccin. GOOOOOOOOOO-!

Known issues: Images need compiling, none of the Wonders have quotes yet, whatever Day Zero fixes I'll be doing once I get all this in game.

08-10-2022 (Version 0.4) 
*Numerous* bugs squashed; wasn't incriminating that because I was going through builds too quickly
Incrementing to 0.4 because I added a modOptions.json to (hopefully) remove the depricated Beliefs.
Now if only I knew why half of the things don't show up, and why the buy with faith stuff isn't showing up.
